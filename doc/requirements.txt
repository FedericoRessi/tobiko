# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# As openstack job build-reno-releasenotes and Read The Docs page support only
# one single requirements file for a project, we need to have one such file
# which will include all project requirements
reno>=3.2.0                   # Apache-2.0
sphinx>=3.4.2                 # BSD
